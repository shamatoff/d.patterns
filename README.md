Design pattern implementations

##Notes:
- The anti patterns will be annotated with @Deprecated tag

##Definitions
- Gamma Categorization
    - Creational Patterns
        - creation and construction of objects
        - Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
        - Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)
    - Structural Patterns
        - ??? Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
        - ??? Wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
        - ??? Stress the importance of good API design.
    - Behavioral Patterns
        - They are all different; no central theme
